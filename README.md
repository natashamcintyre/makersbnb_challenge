## TEAM OREO ##

An imitation of Airbnb, our first team project at Makers. This was our team's attempt in 1 week, a learning opportunity with much scope for improvement and by no means a final product.

MVP

**Any** signed-up **user can list a new space**

**Users should be able to name their space**, provide a short description of the space, and a price per night

**Any** signed-up **user can request to hire any space for one night,** and this should be approved by the user that owns the space
```

```
Users can list multiple spaces

Users should be able to offer a range of dates where their space is available

Nights for which a space has already been booked should not be available for users to book that space

Until a user has confirmed a booking request, that space can still be booked for that night
